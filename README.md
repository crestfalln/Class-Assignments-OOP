### Welcome!

Submitted pdfs are generated from markdown using pandoc. Assignments compiled and tested with gcc 10.2 in linux510-lts.  
MD-files are generated from a [template](template.md) using a [script](https://github.com/crestfalln/assignment-md-maker) that I wrote.
[MD Files](MD%20Files) has the markdown source to all pdfs.
